But women are going to tell different stories \u2013 there would be many more stories in the world if women were making more films.\" This course will look closely at contemporary female-authored films in an effort to honor and attend to these \"different stories\" that often pass under the radar of popular audiences and critical recognition; this course will further explore, through feminist film history and theory, the contexts that have given rise to these films and the socio-political and emotional resonance of these films over time. As Campion suggests, women filmmakers have the potential to tell different stories, to transform our existing set of imagistic possibilities, in ways that expand our spectatorial imagination and even change our political reality. As a means of revising and expanding the canon of film history, this course focuses on 21st-century global films made by women.
